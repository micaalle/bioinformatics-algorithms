The Gibbs Sampler algorithm is a method in which it utilizes repetition in order to find motifs within a data set of DNA strings. By selecting segments of the string at random it is able to replace that segment by looking at how often other letters appear in other segments. Depending on the number of times the algorithm is repeated the results may vary with too high inputs giving room for diminishing returns and low repetition not allowing the algorithm to fully explore the data.
